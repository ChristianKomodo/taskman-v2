# TaskMan App Version 2.0

### My previous TaskMan app, but now with a NodeJS server and Express routing.

The application generates 6 tasks from a possible 10, and when each is checked off, a progress ring shows the current percentage of completion, with a message displaying once 100% is reached.

Navigating to the settings page does not change which items are checked in previous pages.

Clone the repo, install dependencies and run the server with the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/ChristianKomodo/taskman-v2.git`

`npm install`

then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
