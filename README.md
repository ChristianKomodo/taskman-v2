# TaskMan App Version 2.0
My previous TaskMan app, but now with a NodeJS server and Express routing.

Clone the repo, install dependencies and run the server with the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/ChristianKomodo/taskman-v2.git`

`npm install`

then go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
